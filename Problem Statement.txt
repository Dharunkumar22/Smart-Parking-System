Problem Statement:
The problem at hand is to create a Smart Parking System that allows users to check parking slot availability, book parking slots for a specific vehicle type, and unbook them when needed. The system needs to handle different vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck) with their respective booking limits, manage the parking slots efficiently, and provide feedback to the user through notifications and a visual interface.

Key features include:

Dynamic generation of parking slots based on user input.

Ability to book/unbook parking slots.

Vehicle-specific booking limits.

User-friendly interface for interaction.

Storage of parking slot states (e.g., available, booked) using localStorage so the data persists even if the user reloads the page.

Working Principle:
User Inputs:

The system allows the user to input the number of parking slots they want to generate, the type of vehicle (Car, Bike, Truck), and the start and end times for the booking.

Generating Slots:

When the user provides the input and clicks the "Generate Parking Slots" button, the system creates an array of parking slots. Each slot has a status (either "available" or "booked"), a vehicle type (if booked), and a booking time.

Slot Interaction:

Users can click on the parking slots displayed on the page. If the slot is available, they can book it for their selected vehicle. If the slot is already booked, they cannot book it again and will be notified.

When a user books a slot, the system checks if the vehicle type has exceeded the booking limit. If not, the slot gets booked and the status changes accordingly.

Notifications:

After each action (booking or unbooking a slot), a notification will be shown to the user, providing feedback on the success or failure of the action.

Persisting Data:

The status of parking slots is saved in the browser's localStorage, so when the page is refreshed, the system can retrieve and display the current state of the parking slots.

Uses:
Efficient Parking Management:

It can be used by parking management systems to automate and streamline the parking space allocation process, ensuring better utilization of parking slots.

Real-Time Slot Availability:

Users can check real-time availability and make reservations, making it easier to find parking spots in crowded areas.

Vehicle-Specific Parking:

Helps to manage different parking zones based on the vehicle type, ensuring that parking is allocated according to vehicle size and availability (e.g., separate slots for cars, bikes, and trucks).

Automated Slot Booking:

Users can book and unbook slots for a particular time period, automating parking reservations.

Local Storage for Persistence:

Ensures that usersâ€™ interactions are not lost when the page is refreshed or revisited, providing a persistent experience.

Applications:
Urban Parking Management:

This system could be used in smart cities where parking spaces need to be allocated in real-time, and users can reserve parking spots before arriving, reducing the time spent searching for available spaces.

Shopping Malls & Public Areas:

Malls, shopping complexes, and large public spaces with limited parking can implement this system to allow customers to book parking in advance, saving them time and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

Airports and Train Stations:

Airports, train stations, and other transportation hubs can implement this system to manage parking for cars, bikes, and trucks. Travelers could book parking spaces in advance, especially during peak travel times.

Residential Complexes:

For residential areas with shared parking facilities, this system can help residents book their parking slots for specific times, ensuring that the parking area is efficiently used and preventing disputes over space allocation.

Event Venues:

For venues that host large events (concerts, conferences, sports games), this system can be used to manage parking reservations for attendees, ensuring there is adequate space for everyone and improving the experience.

University Campuses:

Universities can use this system for student and faculty parking, allowing them to reserve spots during peak hours, reducing parking problems.

Conclusion:
This Smart Parking System provides a practical solution for efficiently managing parking resources. Its application in real-time parking allocation systems can significantly reduce the hassle of finding available spaces, ensure fair usage based on vehicle type, and make the entire process more automated and user-friendly. It can be applied in various settings like urban areas, public events, and commercial establishments to optimize parking management.
